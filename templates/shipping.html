    <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 17 Jan 2026</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p><strong>Important:</strong> This service is an <strong>Automated Vending Machine</strong> system. Products are delivered <strong>instantly at the machine location</strong> after successful payment. There is <strong>no courier shipping</strong>, <strong>no postal delivery</strong>, and <strong>no physical dispatch</strong> to customer addresses.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. What “Shipping” Means for This Service</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional e-commerce “shipping” involves packing, dispatch, and courier delivery to a customer’s address.
      Our service works differently: a customer scans a QR code at the vending machine, completes a payment through
      Razorpay’s secure checkout, and the machine dispenses the selected product <strong>on-site</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, for our business model, “shipping” refers to <strong>instant delivery at the vending machine location</strong>,
      not delivery through logistics partners.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Delivery Method (No Courier / No Address Delivery)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No address-based delivery:</strong> We do not deliver items to homes, hostels, or any personal address.</li>
      <li><strong>No courier partners:</strong> We do not use courier companies, India Post, or any third-party logistics provider.</li>
      <li><strong>No packaging & dispatch:</strong> Items are stored inside the vending machine and dispensed directly.</li>
      <li><strong>No shipment tracking:</strong> Since there is no shipment, there is no tracking number or shipping status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. When Delivery Happens (Instant Dispensing)</h2>
    <p>
      Delivery occurs when the vending machine dispenses the product after the payment is verified.
      In most cases, dispensing happens <strong>immediately (within seconds)</strong> after a successful payment confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payment verification may take a short time depending on network conditions, payment method, or gateway response.
      If the network is slow, the machine may take longer to confirm payment status.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Delivery Timelines (Why “Shipping Time” is Not Applicable)</h2>
    <p>
      Because there is no courier shipping, typical shipping timelines (e.g., “3–5 days”) do not apply.
      The relevant timeline in our service is <strong>payment verification and dispensing</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Expected dispensing:</strong> Usually within seconds after payment success.</li>
      <li><strong>Possible delay:</strong> In rare cases, delays can occur due to internet issues, gateway response delay, or machine-side connectivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Service Area / Locations</h2>
    <p>
      The service is available only at locations where our Automated Vending Machine is installed and operational.
      Delivery (dispensing) is possible only when the user is physically present at the vending machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a machine is temporarily offline, under maintenance, or out of stock, delivery may not be possible until it is restored.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Stock Availability & Substitution</h2>
    <p>
      Products dispensed depend on available stock inside the machine.
      If a selected item is out of stock, the machine should not accept selection for that item (where supported).
      We do not substitute products without user choice.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Failed Dispensing / Delivery Issues</h2>
    <p>
      A “delivery issue” in our model means <strong>payment is successful but the product is not dispensed</strong>.
      This can happen due to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Temporary mechanical jam or dispensing mechanism issue</li>
      <li>Power interruption at the machine</li>
      <li>Network interruption during payment verification</li>
      <li>Machine maintenance or temporary error state</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If payment is successful and dispensing fails, the transaction will be handled according to our
      <strong>Cancellations & Refunds Policy</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Payments, Confirmation, and Razorpay Processing</h2>
    <p>
      Payments are processed securely via <strong>Razorpay</strong>. We do not store sensitive payment details
      such as UPI PINs, card numbers, or banking credentials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Payment success is determined by Razorpay’s confirmation (and/or captured status depending on method).
      The vending machine dispenses items only after payment is confirmed as successful.
    </p>

    <h2>9. What If a Payment is Debited but Delivery Does Not Happen?</h2>
    <p>
      If your payment is debited but the product is not delivered (dispensed), one of the following may occur:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Auto-reversal by bank/UPI:</strong> Some failed transactions are automatically reversed by the payment system.</li>
      <li><strong>Refund processing:</strong> If payment is captured but dispensing fails, a refund may be initiated as per our refund policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For refund timelines and steps, please refer to our <strong>Cancellations & Refunds Policy</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure you are at the correct vending machine location before paying.</li>
      <li>Follow on-screen instructions on the vending machine during payment.</li>
      <li>Do not leave the machine area until the payment status and dispensing outcome are clear.</li>
      <li>Keep the payment reference/transaction ID (if available) for faster support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Force Majeure / Events Beyond Control</h2>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for delays or failures caused by events beyond reasonable control, such as:
      internet outages, payment network downtime, power failures, natural events, or third-party service disruptions.
      In such cases, delivery may be delayed or temporarily unavailable.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Shipping Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our service, machine locations,
      operational procedures, or compliance requirements. The updated policy will be posted on this page with a revised date.
    </p>

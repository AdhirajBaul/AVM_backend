  <h2>Shipping Policy</h2>

  <p>
    This website operates an <strong>Automated Vending Machine system</strong>
    that provides instant, on-site delivery of products.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>No physical shipping or courier delivery is involved.</strong>
    All products are dispensed immediately from the vending machine
    after successful payment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once a customer completes a payment using the QR code displayed on
    the vending machine, the machine automatically verifies the payment
    and dispenses the selected item.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since this is an automated, location-based service:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>No shipping addresses are collected</li>
    <li>No delivery timelines apply</li>
    <li>No third-party logistics or courier services are used</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the event of a technical failure where payment is successful
    but the item is not dispensed, the transaction will be handled
    according to our <strong>Cancellations and Refunds Policy</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shipping policy applies only to products dispensed via
    the Automated Vending Machine and does not involve any form
    of physical shipping.

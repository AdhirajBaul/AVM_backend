<h2>Cancellations and Refunds</h2>

<p>
Once a payment is made, cancellations are not applicable as the system
attempts immediate item dispensing.
</p>

<p>
If a payment is successful but the item is not dispensed due to a technical issue,
the amount will be refunded automatically or within 5–7 working days.
</p>

<p>
For refund assistance, please contact support.
